## The Problem: Blind Incident Response

You're troubleshooting a Service Bus incident. Azure Portal shows **5,000 messages in Dead-Letter Queue**, but:

❌ **Can't read message content** — Portal only shows counts and basic metadata  
❌ **No search capability** — Can't find messages by correlation ID or customer ID  
❌ **No pattern analysis** — Can't identify which error types are dominating  
❌ **Manual investigation** — Sample one message at a time with no bulk insight  
❌ **Limited DLQ context** — Can't see failure reasons across all dead-lettered messages  

**Result:** 2-hour incidents become 6-hour marathons of blind debugging.

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Dead-Letter Queue Incident
**Problem:** 5,000 orders stuck in DLQ. Customer escalation at 2 AM.  
**ServiceHub Solution:**
1. Browse all 5,000 DLQ messages in seconds
2. AI detects **3 error patterns**: "Payment Timeout" (40%), "Invalid Address" (35%), "Duplicate Order" (25%)
3. Search for specific customer orders by correlation ID
4. After fixing payment gateway, replay all "Payment Timeout" messages with one click

**Time Saved:** 6 hours → 45 minutes

### Scenario 2: Message Correlation Tracking
**Problem:** Customer reports "Order #12345 never processed." Find the message across 10,000 active messages.  
**ServiceHub Solution:**
1. Search across message body, properties, and custom headers
2. Find order in 3 seconds
3. Review full message properties, delivery attempts, and processing timestamps

**Time Saved:** 30 minutes → 30 seconds

### Scenario 3: Integration Testing
**Problem:** Need to test error handling with 100 realistic failure scenarios.  
**ServiceHub Solution:**
1. Use Message Generator with "Payment Gateway" scenario
2. Generate 100 messages with 30% anomaly rate
3. Verify error handling and DLQ behavior
4. Clean up test messages with one filter (tagged `ServiceHub-Generated`)

**Time Saved:** Manual testing → Automated in 2 minutes

- 25% failed due to "Duplicate Order ID"

---

### ⚠️ Dead-Letter Queue Forensics

Investigate DLQ failures with complete context:

![DLQ Investigation](docs/screenshots/21-workflow-dlq-investigation-step1.png)

**See instantly:**
- Dead-letter reason (e.g., "MaxDeliveryCountExceeded")
- Error description from Azure Service Bus
- Delivery attempt history
- Original message timestamp vs. DLQ timestamp

![DLQ Guidance](docs/screenshots/22-workflow-dlq-investigation-step2.png)

**ServiceHub provides actionable guidance:**

---

## Security & Compliance

### Read-Only by Design

ServiceHub uses Azure SDK's **`PeekMessagesAsync`** — messages are **never removed** from queues:

```csharp
// ServiceHub only reads — never receives or deletes
await receiver.PeekMessagesAsync(maxMessages: 100);
```

✅ **Safe for production** — Messages remain in queue for your actual consumers  
✅ **Audit-friendly** — No message deletion or modification  
✅ **Incident-safe** — Won't interfere with recovery processes  

### Minimal Permissions Required

Create a dedicated SAS policy with **Listen permission only**:

```bash
# Azure CLI
az servicebus namespace authorization-rule create \
  --namespace-name <your-namespace> \
  --name servicehub-readonly \
  --rights Listen
```

❌ ServiceHub does NOT require:
- `Manage` permissions
- `Send` permissions (except for testing tools, optional)
- `Receive` permissions (never removes messages)

### Data Privacy

- **No external API calls** — AI analysis runs in your browser
- **No data persistence** — Messages displayed in-memory only
- **No logging of message content** — API logs only metadata (message count, queue names)
- **Self-hosted** — Deploy in your VPC/VNET, no SaaS dependencies

## FAQ

**Q: Does ServiceHub remove messages from queues?**  
A: No. ServiceHub uses Azure SDK's **`PeekMessagesAsync`** which only reads messages without removing them. Your consumers continue processing normally.

**Q: Can I use ServiceHub in production?**  
A: Yes. ServiceHub only requires **Listen** permission and operates in read-only mode (except for optional testing tools). Messages remain in queues for your actual consumers.

**Q: How does AI pattern detection work?**  
A: ServiceHub analyzes message content, properties, and error descriptions using heuristic algorithms **in your browser**. No data leaves your environment — no external AI API calls.

**Q: What about sensitive data in messages?**  
A: ServiceHub displays messages only in your browser session (not persisted). Deploy ServiceHub in your private network and restrict access via your identity provider. API logs do not capture message content.

**Q: Can I deploy ServiceHub to Azure App Service / Kubernetes?**  
A: Yes. ServiceHub is a standard ASP.NET Core + React app. You can containerize it with Docker and deploy to any platform supporting .NET 8 and Node.js.

**Q: Does ServiceHub support topics with subscriptions?**  
A: Yes. ServiceHub browses messages from both queues and topic subscriptions. You can view messages for each subscription independently.

**Q: What about message sessions?**  
A: Session-aware browsing is on the roadmap. Currently, you can view session-enabled messages but not group them by session ID.

**Q: Can I contribute?**  
A: Absolutely! ServiceHub is open source (MIT license). Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
